                <h1 class="section_header">Getting Started</h1>
                <p>So, you’ve decided to start recruiting for an investment banking internship. Even if you know nothing about this process, here are a few things that will help you get started.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Reach out to any person you know that has a job in investment banking or is still in college and recruited for an internship. Your best help is to have someone who has done this process and can aid you throughout it.</li>
                    <li>Start finding bankers to network with. Reference the General Networking tab above to learn how to find and form connections. During the calls, ask for guidance with the recruiting process and learn more about their bank.</li>
                    <li>Research different banks. Use My Leg Up, the internet, and your network to discover which banks you are most interested in. Prioritize these banks, but continue to research other banks as well.</li>
                    <li>Attend recruiting events on campus to network and learn more about each bank. Use the Company Presentations tab above to learn more about them.</li>
                    <li>Start learning technicals. Look through the Breaking Into Wall Street guides or Wall Street Oasis to find the right concepts to study. Also look through the Technical Interviews section above to find more details on how to best study.</li>
                    <li>Find application links as talked about in the Formats + Resources. Be sure to input them into bank pages on My Leg Up to stay organized and on top of due dates.</li>
                    <li>Spend a certain amount of time each week sending cold emails, networking with bankers, and studying technicals.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="gennwcont">
                <h1 class="section_header">General Networking</h1>
                <h3>Building Your Network</h3>
                <p>Leverage your university’s alumni. Finding bankers who are graduates of your school is a great way to connect and potentially set up a networking phone call. Use the screening feature on LinkedIn to find people who went to your school and are working at the bank you are trying to network with.</p>
                <p>One good practice during recruiting is to spend a couple of hours at the start of each week finding people and schedule sending emails to them asking for networking calls. For reference, schedule send is a feature on google mail that allows you to set a future send time to any email. Schedule send is your friend because if you’re up at 11PM on a Sunday finding these people, it’s unprofessional to send those emails late at night or on a weekend. Use odd times in the morning like 8:12 or 9:03 to schedule send, because the traditional 8:00 on the dot email basically tells them you’re schedule sending. However, if you are scheduled to send, make sure you are awake during the time it sends. This way, if a banker responds immediately after it sends, you can respond back and potentially get a quick phone call out of it. Another good practice is to send a majority of your cold emails on Tuesdays. That way, analysts' inboxes aren’t swamped from the weekend and/or busy Mondays, and you’ll typically get a better response rate.</p>
                <h3>Networking Goals</h3>
                <p>The goal of networking should be to have your name become recognizable at the firms you like. Most banks' recruiting processes have analysts select certain candidates who stuck out to them when networking. These are the candidates who typically score an interview. Because of this, oftentimes the quality of calls is more important than the quantity, however quantity is never a bad thing. At your top firms, try to speak to 4-6 people. Aim to leave a positive, lasting impression on at least 3 contacts. For your other firms, try to reach 3 calls. The thing about getting interviews, though, is that some people with one single call will get it over someone with four. It’s a crapshoot, but by having more calls and more people who know you at the firm, you put yourself in a better position to get one. Be strategic with your time, however. It is definitely better to have 3 calls at 8 banks than 1 or 2 calls at 16.</p>
                <h3>Networking Calls</h3>
                <p>Networking calls mainly test your ability to speak with others. Many recruiters state that half the battle in this process is being personable. During networking calls, be sure to ask genuine questions about analysts’ jobs and their lives. Although the process seems superficial and that networking is just a check the box, developing one genuine connection at a bank is a big help. They can help you from the inside and give you advice throughout the process. Before phone calls, write down a list of questions that you want to ask. If the conversation goes dry, use that list to spark up some more discussion. If you’ve researched the person or heard them speak at a recruiting event, try to ask tailored questions towards their experiences to show that you’ve prepared for the call. You can find some example questions for networking calls on the “formats and resources” tab.</p>
                <p>During phone calls, it is common practice to spend the first 5ish minutes with some small talk: asking them how they’re doing and talking about their day/week so far. When the conversation fades, ask to hear about their story: where they’re from, their time in college, and why they chose banking- stuff along those lines. This way, they tell a story about their lives, and you can ask questions to branch off of it. Especially when they talk about their time at their firm, make sure to ask some questions about deal experience, company culture, and other professional questions to show interest in their job. Finally, it’s a good practice to end the call asking about what they like to do outside of work, to discover more about their interests, hobbies, etc. Aim to speak for around 25-30 minutes, but some calls go shorter or longer naturally. Always remember to thank them as you hang up, and to send a thank you email either a couple hours later or the following day. If the call went well, sometimes you may ask if they’d recommend you speak with another banker from their firm. This is sometimes a difficult situation because it could backfire if the banker thinks you are just using them for another call. If you want to ask, do so in a polite way, and explain that you simply want to learn about another person’s perspective at the firm.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="send_emails">
                <h1 class="section_header">Email Management</h1>
                <h3>Subject Lines</h3>
                <p>First, always start your subject lines with your first and last name. The more bankers see your name, the better: name recognition is super important. After your name, put a dash, and then the occasion for the email: whether that be a thank you note, or simply networking for a phone call. Additionally, if you have a connection, always add that to the subject line so it pops out and grabs their attention as they’re scrolling through their inbox. To note: some people prefer to write the occasion for the email before their name (ie. Thank You- Your Name) as the structure for their subject lines. In that case, the structure of the following examples would be reversed. These examples for potential subject lines are: Your Name- Thank You for Call, Your Name- U of M Student Reaching Out, Your Name- Interested in (Firm Name), Your Name- Friend of (Connection) Reaching Out. Remember, these bankers get hundreds of emails per day from clients, co-workers, and sophomores like you, so try to stand out with your email subject lines.</p>
                <h3>Follow Up Emails</h3>
                <p>Whenever you send a cold email and don’t get a response, wait one week from the time you sent it and then follow up. It’s important not to appear rude or too pushy with these emails, as bankers are extremely busy and they could have simply missed your email. Check the “formats and resources” section for help on this. If bankers don’t respond a second time, most people typically move on and focus their time on another contact. However, if you believe that it’s super important that you talk to this person, wait another week after the second email to give it one last go.</p>
                <h3>Thank You Emails</h3>
                <p>In the “formats and resources” section, there are 3 examples of thank you emails: one after a networking event, one after a networking phone call, and another after an interview. For each of these, your timing should be a little different. The general rule for all thank you emails is to send them 2-24 hours after the call/event. For networking events, it’s not super important when you send your thank you email; typically the next day is a good time. In terms of networking phone calls, if the call is in the morning, send the thank you email that afternoon. However, if the call is in the afternoon, send it the next day (try not to send any email past 5:30 or 6PM, as it’s unprofessional to do so that late). It’s also common practice to not send thank yous right after the call. Let the call digest with them, and then when they see your thank you note later on, it’ll leave a good impression. The only time it is best to send an email to them shortly after talking with a banker is with interviews. Sometimes the interviewers are making decisions about super days or offers only a few hours after the interview. Here, it is best to send thank you notes about 1-2 hours after the interview to ensure that they see the note before making decisions.</p>

            <div class="comp_pres">
                <h1 class="section_header">Company Presentations</h1>
                <h3>At Recruiting Events</h3>
                <p>It is important to leave a good impression at company presentations and networking sessions. During the presentation, be sure to bring a pen and paper to take notes on the firm (using a computer is unprofessional). Write notes on the company profile, reputation, and your thoughts on the speakers. As much as the process is about the bank finding their ideal candidates, you should be critical of the firm too. If you thought the bank reps seemed boring or rude, maybe that’s a bank you put at the bottom of your list. Fit is a two-way street. Be sure to write down the names of the bankers who are there, because those names are important when sending thank you emails and potentially setting up calls. During the networking portion of events, people will circle up with bankers and ask questions one at a time. One valuable part of this comes from catching a point they talk about, because then you can use that point in a thank you email to them. For example, if you hear Analyst X talking about their time on a deal in England for the TMT group, it’s a great practice to mention that in your thank you email. That way, your email is more personable, and you are more likely to get a call if you ask for one. Besides that, ask questions you are genuinely interested in hearing the answers to. Specific questions make you more memorable as well.</p>
                <h3>Emails and Sign Up Links</h3>
                <p>The next day, be sure to send thank you emails to all of the bankers that you spoke with. You can ask them for calls, or just thank them for their time. Either way, it’s respectful to show gratitude for their time and effort hosting the event. Check out the “formats and resources” section for an example of this type of email.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="behav_int">
                <h1 class="section_header">Behavioral Interviews</h1>
                <p>Interviews can be nerve wracking. For investment banking, sometimes only 5-10% of applicants get interviews, so be proud of yourself, confident in your abilities, and know that you belong in that room.</p>
                <h3>Importance of Behaviorals</h3>
                <p>A common myth in this process is that technicals are more important than behaviorals. While getting down your technicals is definitely important, the real way you differentiate yourself is through behaviorals. The bank wants to know who you are, what you’ve done, why you’d be a good fit at the firm, and how well you can articulate those answers.</p>
                <h3>Common Questions Explained</h3>
                <p>The most important 3 questions for each behavioral interview (you’ll get all 3 of these questions 95% of the time) are 1) tell me about yourself, 2) why do you want to go into investment banking, and 3) why are you interested in our firm.</p>
                <p>The answers to these three questions should tell the interviewers a lot about you, and it is your time to differentiate yourself. Your response to the “Tell me about yourself” question should be about 2-3 minutes long. To note, it should be treated similarly to the question, “Walk me through your resume.” The answer should start with your interests and/or passions, and why that led you to study business/economics/your major. Next, weave in your experiences on your resume and explain how that led you to recruit for investment banking. The “Why IB” question should be personal to you. A lot of people mention the following ideas: you will learn a ton about the finance world, you’re working in such a fast paced environment, you have a lot of responsibility right out of college, and you will work with MDs and C-Suite executives of huge companies. Finally, the “Why ______ Bank?” is obviously dependent on each bank, and should be genuine for each. One answer structure that many people follow is as follows: place, people, program. Add specific examples/ details in each category to explain why you would love to work at ________ bank. Many people reference their favorite networking call in this question, stating that they really enjoyed talking to him/her. People also mention a specific deal that the firm advised on that they are interested in. In general, before interviews, be sure to know some details about at least 2 deals that the firm has worked on. Additionally, at the end of interviews, certain firms like to ask the question, “Why should we hire you?” This is another answer you should prepare. Focus on pitching yourself by showing your competitive advantage that you’ll bring to the firm. Also, firms might ask you to explain what investment bankers do. Make sure to have that answer in the back of your mind as well.</p>
                <h3>Other Common Questions Explained</h3>
                <p>The next most popular set of questions focus on your resume. Anything you put on your resume is fair game for bankers to ask about. Make sure you know your resume like the back of your hand, including all the details of your experiences and your additional section. If you state that you have financial modeling experience, be ready to talk about it in depth.</p>
                <p>Other common interview questions that banks often ask about are related to: your strengths and weaknesses, times you were a leader, times you failed and how you came back from that, an experience of teamwork, your role in teams, a current event, stock, and M&A deal you’re following, and your favorite book. Some firms love asking current event questions to see if you are up to date on what’s going on in the business world. The Morning Brew is a great news source that will have you ready to answer current event questions.</p>

             <div class="tech_int">
                <h1 class="section_header">Technical Interviews</h1>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>After asking upperclassmen at your school about their recruiting processes, the average recommended date to start learning technicals is December 10th, and the average recommended date to be interview-ready with technicals is February 23rd. However, this part of the process is entirely dependent on the person, as technicals take some people much longer to learn than others. Plus, as recruiting processes start earlier each year, it is important to not slack on learning technicals. Either way, the Breaking Into Wall Street (BIWS) guides are your best resource. Most questions asked come straight from these guides, or the concepts behind them. There are 6 technical guides in total: Accounting, Equity/Enterprise Value, Valuation, DCFs, Merger Models, and LBOs. Each guide is split into a couple sections. First, they break down the main ideas by concept, which is a great way to learn the content. Then, they give practice questions, split up by difficulty: basic and advanced. Most often, banks don’t ask questions from the advanced sections. It’s important to familiarize yourself with those sections, but it’s extremely difficult to master every topic. Try your best, but know that most of the technical questions you’ll be asked will come from the basic sections (however, if you’re interviewing for tough boutiques like Evercore, M Klein, or Financo, be prepared for some advanced questions). There is also a 400 questions guide which encompassess all of these technicals, and some behaviorals as well.</p>
                <h3>Common Questions Explained</h3>
                <p>There are a couple technical questions that traditionally get asked more than others, so be sure to know them. On accounting, understand the 3 financial statements, how they connect, and how a $20 increase in depreciation affects the 3 statements. For the next guide, know the formulas for enterprise and equity value, and what each metric means. For valuation, know the difference between an intrinsic and relative valuation. Understand the 4 main valuation methods (DCF, Comps, Precedent Transactions, and LBOs), and be able to roughly rank them according to expected value. Next, be able to walk an interviewer through a DCF. Know how to get from revenue to free cash flows, the WACC calculation, and the overall concept behind the valuation method. Understand the idea behind a merger model, and know some main reasons why a company would choose to acquire another. Finally, understand the concept of an LBO, and how a PE firm can increase their IRR.</p>
                <h3>Learning Technicals</h3>
                <p>Traditionally, people spend weeks going through the guides, handwriting the concepts, and answering questions. It’s important to go through this productive struggle when starting out. After having a general understanding of the guides, most people study in 2 different ways. First is mock interviewing. Use your school’s peer coaches, older friends who have recruited, and your friends currently recruiting with you. Sometimes giving mock interviews to your friends helps you just as much as receiving one. Aim for one mock interview every few days during interview season to keep yourself sharp. The second common way to practice is using the website IB Vine. It’s basically a quizlet for technicals, but you can filter it by concept and difficulty. Try to spend 15 minutes every other day on IB Vine to keep yourself ready for interviews.</p>
                <h3>More General Interview Tips</h3>
                <p>One last note about technical interviews: don’t walk into an interview room pretending like you know everything. Interviewers appreciate humility. If they ask you a question that you’re unsure of, it’s more than acceptable to say, “Honestly, I’m not quite sure, but my best thought is _____ because of ______.” They know that you are a sophomore in college, and that you don’t know everything. Plus, if an interviewer senses that you’re not as educated on a topic as you are trying to make it seem, they could grill you on it. Another piece of advice is to always come prepared with many more questions than you anticipate having time for. Sometimes interviews will end after 15 minutes, and the floor is yours to ask questions. Questions should mainly be about the interviewer’s experiences, their time at the firm, the internship role you are applying for, or any professional question you are curious about.</p>
                <h3>Last Note</h3>
                <p>Finally, be excited to be there. Show up with a smile and confidence. All of your networking and prep landed you here, and this is the time to show all the hard work you put in. Take advantage of the moment, and land the super day or offer.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="temps">
                <h1 class="section_header">Formats + Resources</h1>
                <h3>Applications</h3>
                <p>You are responsible for finding application links for each firm. If you are in a club on campus, these typically get sent around. However, if you are not, you should search the web for them. They’re easy to find by simply searching “(Firm) 2024 Investment Banking Summer Internship,” but you need to be on top of finding them and inputting them into each bank page on My Leg Up. This way, you can stay organized with your application due dates and be sure to submit all of them on time.</p>
                <h3>Resumes</h3>
                <p>Getting personalized help for improving your resume is extremely beneficial. If your school offers help either through peer coaches or a Career Development Office, definitely use it. However, if you don’t have those resources, here are some general notes on resumes. Your resume should be split into 3 sections: Education, Experience, and Additional. For Education, add your University/College, intended degree, GPA, majors/minors, and any awards or honors you have received. For the Experience section, you should have 3-5 experiences that you can tailor towards a career in banking. For each experience, include 3 bullets explaining what you did. For each bullet, use the Action, Context, Result (ACR) format to give a holistic summary of your experience. This means starting each bullet with an action word, like created, facilitated, or led. Then, provide enough context so the reader can understand what you did during the experience. Finally, indicate the deliverable you finished or the impact you made on the company. Including numerical values for quantification of impact is great. Finally, the Additional section is your space to add hobbies, interests, and fun facts. Unique additional sections are traditionally the best.</p>
                <h3>Cover Letters</h3>
                <p>Much like resumes, personalized advice is helpful for cover letters. Career Development Offices are definitely a great resource for cover letter reviews. Traditionally, cover letters should be addressed to the bank’s office that you are recruiting to. Then you can follow that with “To whom it may concern” or “To (Bank Name)’s Recruiting Team.” The content of the cover letter should start with a brief introduction, and then list 2-3 reasons why you think you are qualified for the position. Next, go in-depth about these 2-3 reasons in consequent paragraphs. Finally, end with a recap of your points, thank them for reading, and sign your name at the bottom. Try to fit your cover letter on one page.</p>
                <h3>Example Questions for Networking Calls</h3>
                <ul>
