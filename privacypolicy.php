            <p>We use “cookies” to collect information and improve our products and services. A cookie is a small data file that is stored on your device.

We do not control these parties. You should review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personal information.</p>
            <p>Regarding online tracking, because we do not track our Website users over time and across third-party websites, we do not respond to do-not-track signals.</p>

We will make reasonable efforts to notify you should your personal information be subject to disclosure by law.</p>
            <p>We will keep your personal information only for as long as needed for the purposes identified above, as required by law, or as necessary to resolve any disputes you may have concerning our services.
